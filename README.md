Design patterns planned to implmement:
I will use the abstract Factory to create the player object without specifying what class

I will use the factory method to create the enemies the player faces, these enemies will be able to be scaled to the players power/leve

I will use the memento design pattern to save the main character between levels or if the program is terminated

I will use the composite design pattern to compose each level out of multiple enemies and objects that the main character will interact with.
